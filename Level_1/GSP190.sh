Task 1 - Viewing the available permissions for a resource
$(splitter)
The following command will output a VERY long listing of permissions that can be set for a role.
Feel free to interrupt the output using Ctrl-C.

This command will not write anything to the project.

Task 2 - Getting the role matadata
$(splitter)
The following example output what permissions a role has (the "$ROLE_IN_QUESTION" role in this case)

This command will not write anything to the project.
EOF

Task 3 - Viewing the grantable roles on resources

The following command outputs a listing of roles that can be assigned to a user/service account.

This command will not write anything to the project.

Task 4 - Create a custom role using YAML file
$(splitter)
This task uses YAML file to describe a role with proper permissions.
We'll be create a new role using a YAML file.

Here's the content of the "$YAML_FILE" YAML file

EOF

Task 5 - Create a custom role using flags
$(splitter)
Instead of using a YAML file, IAM role can also be described in one command.

We've created 2 custom roles so far.
This task will demonstrate how to list custom role of a project.

Additionally, adding the "--show-deleted" flag at the end can show deleted roles.
Since we've not deleted anything yet, we will not demonstrate here.

Using the command "gcloud iam roles list" can show all predefined roles.
Similar to the command used in task 3.
